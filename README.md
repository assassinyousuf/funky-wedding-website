# funky-wedding-website
A fun interactive website made for Adil Mohammad Rion ðŸ˜œ

## UI updates (Nov 2025)


## Fresh rebuild (three-step flow)

This workspace was reset to a minimal, fresh implementation that follows the requested three-step flow:

- Step 1: "Are you Adil Mohammad Rion?" â€” if No, the site is terminated and access is blocked.
- Step 2: "Biya kobe korben vaai?" â€” If Yes, proceed to step 3; if No, the flow ends politely.
- Step 3: "Date ta boilla jan" â€” collect a date and optional note; submitted date is saved as a comment (in localStorage).

Open `index.html` in a browser to try the flow. The UI is intentionally simple and mobile-friendly. Comments are stored in browser localStorage.

Open `index.html` in a browser to preview. The site links to Google Fonts so an internet connection is required to load fonts.
